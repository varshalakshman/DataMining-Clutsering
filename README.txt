How to run the code:
1) Please find the Code.ipynb file inside the submitted Project folder.
2) Note that in order to run the code you need to place the data files (pca_a.txt, pca_b.txt and pca_c.txt) inside the same folder in which the Code.ipynb is placed. 
3) Open the Code.ipynb file in the Jupyter Notebook.
4) Run all the cells to see the outputs.
   [Note that in the second cell in the jupyter notebook you need to enter the data-file name for which you want to perform dimensionality reduction and obtain the scatter plots.]
